# Calculator

A simple calculator website that everyone has definitely not done yet. Just like any other calculator, it has features that allow the user to perform **basic arithmetic operations**. It also follows **PEMDAS precedence**, meaning operations are executed in the proper order from left-to right based on their precedence. These operations include:

* **Addition**: Low precedence
* **Subtraction**: Low precedence 
* **Multiplication**: High precedence
* **Division**: High precedence

> [!NOTE]
> Dividing by 0 will either leave a negative or positive Infinity value. This value will be cleared after the next input. Additionally, dividing 0 by 0 will leave an Error value.
