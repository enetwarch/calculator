# [Calculator](https://enetwarch.github.io/calculator/)

A simple calculator website that everyone has definitely not done yet. Just like any other calculator, it has features that allow the user to perform **basic arithmetic operations**. These operations include:

* Addition
* Subtraction 
* Multiplication 
* Division 

> [!NOTE]
> Dividing by 0 will either leave a negative or positive Infinity value. This value will be cleared after the next input.
